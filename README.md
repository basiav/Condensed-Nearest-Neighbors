# Condensed-Nearest-Neighbors

Custom Condensed Nearest Neighbors algorithm implementation, compatible with Scikit-learn class KNeighborsTransformer and with PyNNDescentTransformer, hence can be used in machine learning related projects, similarily as any other Transformer class.


The implementation is based on: Hart, Peter. "The condensed nearest neighbor rule (corresp.)." IEEE transactions on information theory 14.3 (1968): 515-516. [link](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=7c3771fd6829630cf450af853df728ecd8da4ab2)

The algorithm allows *
